    "I must refer to the California Housing Dataset and the end-to-end machine learning project that the professor taught us in Week 2 and 3 of this course, and perform the tasks assigned for this problem set. \n",
    "Specifically, in this assignment, I must load the data, train and test the dataset on two models:\n",
    "1) Model 1 which uses stratified sampling - i.e., divide the dataset into four stratas/quartiles using the variable median_income' and ocean_proximity. This stratfication gives me a new auxilary variable which has 'ocean_proximity and income quartile'. I must then use this variable to split the dataset into training and testing and perform a regression.\n",
    "2) Model 2 which uses random sampling strategy to split the dataset into training and testing and then I must perform regression.\n",
    "Once I have the results of the two models, I then need to compare and evaluate the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, I have refered to the Week 2 codes that the instructor had taught in the class. However, it seems that the codes for loading the data are from the previous edition of Geron's textbook. Therefore, I referred to the online version of Geron's Third Edition Textbook - Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, and followed the instructions of loading the data. The updated dataset and codes have been provided by the author here - https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/02_end_to_end_machine_learning_project.ipynb. I have used all my codes refering as provided in this link. \n",
